                    <h2><u>Health Risks, Age, & Income Correlations</u></h2>
                    <p>Poverty Analysis: When the poverty button is clicked, it is clear that there is somewhat of a correlation between those who <i>lack</i> healthcare options and whether or not they are likely to be in poverty. The higher the poverty
                        percentage goes, the more likely people in certain states are to be without healthcare.</p>

                    <p>Age Analysis: When the age button is clicked, we can see that most states are clustered in the middle of the graph in regards to age and the percentage of people lacking healthcare. This could potentially mean that some individuals
                        in certain states with a median age of 36-40 could not have healthcare due to their age.
                    </p>

                    <p>Household Income Analysis: When the household income button is clicked, we see that those individuals who have a salary that is on the lower end of the graph are less likely to have healthcare. This is likely due to a multitude of
                        reasons but at the very root of it all, they can not afford it as easily as those who in fact have higher salaries.</p>
